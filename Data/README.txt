aaa: axes
     (e.g. dkl = {delta, kappa, lambda} = {disorder, coupling, max. Lyap. exponent})
     (e.g. tnt = {t, n, theta dot} = {time, pendulum index, angular velocity})
  b: number of pendula
     (e.g. 2)
ccc: mean length multiplied by 100
     (e.g. 099 = 0.99)
ddd: disorder type
     (e.g. alt = alternating binary disorder)
     (e.g. any = any disorder type)*
  e: complete?
     (e.g. 0 = no)**
  f: (OPTIONAL) other disambiguation
     (e.g. a = point a in Fig. 6 (right))
     (e.g. 0 = infinite coupling limit)

*for 2 pendula, which fill the mean-preserving pendulum length space
**if not complete, then grid {min horiz, max horiz}x{min vert, max vert} is not filled.
