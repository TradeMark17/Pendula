# About
This repository is the companion code- and data-base for the upcoming Gallego et al. publication, *Lyapunov landscape elucidates disorder-taming-chaos in arrays of coupled pendula*, in Physics Letters A.

*This repository ...*

## Contains:
  1. C-language code used to do all C-related simulation and data collection.
  2. Raw data for Figs. 3, 4, 6, 7, and A.9.
  3. Pendula.nb, which generates the pendulum lengths of Eqs. (4), calculates the population standard deviations of Eqs. (9), and plots the positive semicircle of Eq. (10), shown in Fig. 3.

## Does not contain:
  1. Wolfram-language code used to do all Wolfram-related simulation, analysis, and plotting. This is because the Wolfram codebase is complex, nonstandardized, and stored across many notebooks. It may be available upon request to the corresponding author.
  2. Raw data for the other Figures, for the same reasons. May be available upon request.
